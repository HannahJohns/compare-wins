## What are Generalised Pairwise Comparisons?

Generalised Pairwise Comparisons estimate the chance that a randomly selected participant from the treatment group will have a better outcome than a randomly selected participant from the control group. Other names for the approach include the Win Ratio and Desirability Of Outcome Ranking (DOOR)

Because the idea of 'better outcome' is extremely general, Generalised Pairwise Comparisons can consider trade-offs between multiple clinical outcomes. This allows the approach to better reflect the multifaceted nature of health outcomes.
